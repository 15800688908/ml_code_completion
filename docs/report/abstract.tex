Large projects such as kernels, drivers and libraries follow a code
style, and have recurring patterns. In this project, we explore learning based
code recommendation, to use the project context and give meaningful
suggestions.
Using word vectors to model code tokens, and neural network based learning
techniques, we are able to capture interesting patterns, and predict code that
that cannot be predicted by a simple grammar and syntax based approach as in
conventional IDEs.
We achieve a prediction accuracy of 67.5\% (top-3 accuracy of 83.6\%) on Linux
kernel, a C project, and 47.9\% (top-3 accuracy of 66.5\%) on Twisted, a Python
networking library excluding cases where the next token is rare and not in the
window. Including all such cases, the absolute accuracy is 56.0\% for
Linux and 40.6\% for Twisted.
